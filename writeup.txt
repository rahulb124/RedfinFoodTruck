To take this project from a proof-of-concept command line application to a full web application for many users we must be mindful of the amount of API requests we are making.  We must also understand the main use cases of the user and can implement features that would benefit the user. 
As this project will be used by many users in San Francisco, we must understand that we cannot do a request for every user looking to use our web app.  Knowing this we should instead look to store the food truck data requested from the API in a database or local cache and do filtering from our database/cache instead of making a seperate API call for each user.  
I would also implement features that would benefit users by filtering Food Trucks that are nearby the users location or notifying users of Food Trucks that will be closing soon.  These features could easily be implemented by filtering data stored in the database/cache.
Finally, it is important to handle errors both from the backend system that makes API calls/requests and handling non-200 status codes as well as handling user input in the future version of the application.
